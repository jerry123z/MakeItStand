# Make it stand

To run the project you will need to have unity installed. The version we suggest is 2019.4.16f1 as this is the version we used to build the project.
An executable will be included in the /Builds folder.

If you install Unity Hub (personal free licences are available) with the listed version you will also be able to view the scene in the Unity Editor.
The project folder can be added to unity hub and openned from the GUI.
